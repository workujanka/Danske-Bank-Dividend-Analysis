# 📊 Danske Bank Dividend Analysis (1994–2024)

This repository presents a 30-year analysis of Danske Bank’s dividend performance using **SQLite** for structured data querying and **Excel** for visualization. The project focuses on two key financial KPIs:

- **Dividend Growth Over Time** — tracks year-by-year changes in dividend per share, highlighting suspensions, recoveries, and strategic shifts.
- **Payout Ratio Trends** — reveals how much of the bank’s net income was distributed to shareholders, offering insight into dividend policy and financial strategy.
