Danske Bank Dividend Analysis (1994–2024)
This analysis explores Danske Bank’s dividend performance over 30 years using two key financial KPIs: Dividend Growth and Payout Ratio Trends. The data was processed and visualized using SQLite for structured querying and Excel for charting and interpretation.

Why These Two KPIs?
We selected Dividend Growth and Payout Ratio because they offer the clearest lens into:

Shareholder reward patterns — how payouts evolved across crises and recoveries.

Corporate strategy — how much profit the bank chose to distribute versus retain.

These metrics are especially useful for long-term investors, financial educators, and dividend policy analysts.

Dividend Growth Over Time

Insights:

Sharp declines in 2008 and 2022 (−100%) reflect full dividend suspensions.

Strong rebounds in 2014 and 2023–2024, with growth exceeding +100%.

Flat years (e.g., 1995–1998, 2001–2002) suggest policy conservatism or earnings plateau.

Interpretation: Dividend growth reveals how external shocks and internal strategy shape shareholder returns. It’s a dynamic signal of confidence, caution, or recovery.

Payout Ratio Trends
Chart Summary: This chart tracks the percentage of net income paid out as dividends each year.

Insights:

High ratios in 1994, 2001, and 2024 (~80%) show generous distribution.

Near-zero ratios in 2009–2011 and 2022 reflect dividend suspensions or minimal earnings.

Post-2012 variability shows a shifting balance between reinvestment and payout.

Interpretation: Payout ratio is a strategic KPI that links profitability to dividend policy. It helps assess whether a company is prioritizing growth, stability, or shareholder income.
