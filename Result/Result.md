📊 Danske Bank Dividend Analysis (1994–2024)

This analysis explores Danske Bank’s dividend performance over 30 years using two key financial KPIs: Dividend Growth and Payout Ratio Trends. The data was processed and visualized using SQLite for structured querying and Excel for charting and interpretation.

🔹 Why These Two KPIs?

We selected Dividend Growth and Payout Ratio because they offer the clearest lens into:

Shareholder reward patterns — how payouts evolved across crises and recoveries.

Corporate strategy — how much profit the bank chose to distribute versus retain.

These metrics are especially useful for long-term investors, financial educators, and dividend policy analysts.

Insights:

📉 Sharp declines in 2008 and 2022 (−100%) reflect full dividend suspensions.

📈 Strong rebounds in 2014 and 2023–2024, with growth exceeding +100%.

🟰 Flat years (e.g., 1995–1998, 2001–2002) suggest policy conservatism or earnings plateau.

Interpretation: Dividend growth reveals how external shocks and internal strategy shape shareholder returns. It’s a dynamic signal of confidence, caution, or recovery.

📊 Payout Ratio Trends

Chart Summary: This chart tracks the percentage of net income paid out as dividends each year.

Insights:

🟢 High ratios in 1994, 2001, and 2024 (~80%) show generous distribution.

🔻 Near-zero ratios in 2009–2011 and 2022 reflect dividend suspensions or minimal earnings.

🔄 Post-2012 variability shows a shifting balance between reinvestment and payout.

Interpretation: Payout ratio is a strategic KPI that links profitability to dividend policy. It helps assess whether a company is prioritizing growth, stability, or shareholder income.
